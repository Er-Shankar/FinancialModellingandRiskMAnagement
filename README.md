In this notebook I have implemented the multi-period bionomial model and use it for - 

1. Pricing European options.
2. Finding the right time to excecute American put options (it is never optimal to excercise an American call option early.)

As an extension, I use Black-scholes model for calibrating the multi-period bionomial tree.

In this series of notebooks I have implemented the multi-period bionomial model and use it for - 

1. Pricing European options.
2. Finding the right time to excecute American put options (it is never optimal to excercise an American call option early.)

As an extension, I use Black-scholes model for calibrating the multi-period bionomial tree.

In the next series, I intend to price the following fixed income derivatives,

1. Zero coupon bonds
2. Options on bonds
3. Bonds futures and forwards
4. Swaps and swapsons
